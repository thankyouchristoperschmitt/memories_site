I met Christopher at my first CSS Dev Conf at the Stanley Hotel in Colorado. I often feel awkward and alone at conferences, but I remember sitting next to him at dinner in the hotel's restaurant and having a truly engaging conversation. In the back of my mind I thought, I'm literally nobody in this community and they guy who runs this thing is talking to me like a peer. Being in such a special place with such special people will always be one of the highlights of my career. Thanks, Christopher and Ari.
