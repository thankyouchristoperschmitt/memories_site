My only interaction with Chris was at CSS Dev Conf in 2015. I remember that he was a very down to earth, approachable guy and didn't give the impression that he was above anyone else. Just a humble guy who was genuinely friends with those who worked under his oversight. I was shocked and saddened to hear of his passing. He will be missed by many.
