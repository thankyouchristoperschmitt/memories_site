I had the honor of working with Christopher on several books including the CSS Cookbooks. He brought me on board as a co-author of Adapting to Web Standards: CSS and Ajax For Big Sites. We recently reconnected online in 2019 when I presented Knowbilityâ€™s AccessU. Thank you, Christopher, for the opportunity to work with you in the publishing world.
