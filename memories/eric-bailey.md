There are a lot of ways to make something on the web. A comparison could be choosing to build a house with walls made out of wood, or building one with walls made out of paper. Both will be recognizable as a house, but only one will be built to last.

Christopher made houses to last. Not only that, he wrote, spoke, and taught others how to do it. In addition, he organized events for like-minded people as a way to all learn from each other.

Christopher also made sure everyone could live in these houses. His work in the digital accessibility space made sure that nobody was not left out in the cold.

In every way, Christopher made things better for those around him. I never got to meet him in person, but I've read his books, watched his talks, and chatted with him online. I consider him a friend and I'll miss him a lot.
