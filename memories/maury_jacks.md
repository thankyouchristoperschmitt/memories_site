I have known Ari and her boys since I moved into the house across the street in 2001. Christopher was a great addition to the neighborhood. I first got to know him as a neighbor, but later realized we also had the Alamo Drafthouse as a common thread. Soon, I realized that we both shared many friends exclusive of our neighborhood which was wild to me.

My favorite memory of Christopher is when he let me [put him in one of my Fantastic Fest bumpers as Chewbacca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Q_nlSULio). He was game, and I think we had fun (although it was pretty hot in that outfit for him). What a great man.
