I have known Ari and her boys since I moved into the house across the street in 2001. Christopher was a great addition to the neighborhood. I first got to know him as a neighbor, but later realized we also had the Alamo Drafthouse as a common thread. Soon, I realized that we both shared many friends exclusive of our neighborhood which was wild to me.

My favorite memory of Christopher is when he let me put him in one of my Fantastic Fest bumpers as Chewbacca. He was game, and I think we had fun (although it was pretty hot in that outfit for him). What a great man.
