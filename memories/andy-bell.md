Thereâ€™s one memory that sticks out for me. We were chatting about CSS and somehow the legendary CSS Specificity posters from CSS Dev Conf cropped up. Christopher _insisted_ on shipping me some for free and I had to almost force shipping reimbursement on him because Iâ€™m all the way in the UK! One of the posters hangs proudly in my office and now, often makes me tear up.

This is just one of many hundred stories of how large Christopherâ€™s heart was and how generous he was. Christopher's support has always been especially welcome because Iâ€™ve looked up to him for the majority of my career in the web. I already miss him so much. I miss his occasional messages of support which I keep reading back. Weâ€™ve lost such a good person and an incredibly important member of our community.

Rest well, Christopher ðŸ’œ
