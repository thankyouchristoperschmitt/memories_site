There are so many times that Chris made me smile and laugh that it's so hard to just choose one memory. My favorite memory is the day Chris called me up and asked if I would accompany him to the car dealership pretending to be his fake wife as a buffer between him and the aggressive salesman. I seemed to do a pretty good job because we left there with a ton of laughs and a beautiful Honda Element! We headed to the top of the FSU Parking garage for a new car photoshoot and then Chris brought me to Macaroni Grill to celebrate our fake annulment.

I always knew that a phone call from Chris would end in something fun like Bingo, Jenga, Mario Party, Springtime Tallahassee, Segway rides, or lake house adventures. I am forever grateful I had the opportunity to be his friend!
