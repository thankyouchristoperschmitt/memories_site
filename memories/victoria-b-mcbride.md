Although we only had visits with Chris a couple of times, we loved how warm and kind he was. We liked him right away! John and I are maddog Star Wars Fans and it was our delight to find a kindred spirit! Anytime I think of Chris, I have good memories and I will always think of Chewbacca! I hope that's not a bad thing to say!
