Christ invited me to speak at the JavaScript Summit in 2013, which was one of my first conferences I spoke at. My career as a front-end developer was taking off and I remember Chris being so incredibly positive and encouraging even when I wanted to crumble.

I had the opportunity to work with Chris at Frontend Masters, and he was always so kind and funny and never missed a chance to jump in on a quirky joke. We can tell a lot about a person by the shape they leave on the lives of the people around them. When we assemble all of the people that Christopher has touched with his life, I am certain it would be in the shape of one very big heart. Thank you, Christopher, for being an inflection point in my life and setting such a great example of what we can be to the communities we exist in.
