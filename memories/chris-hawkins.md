Attending and speaking at CSS Dev Conf in New Orleans was the best conference experience I've ever had. The love and care that went in to every detail of the events that Christopher was a part of organizing was undeniable. I'm thankful for my brief opportunity getting to know Christopher and I will always remember the experiences he was responsible for creating. Thank you to all those that participate and help in remembering the kindness and good will created by Christopher and his endeavors.
