I presented at several events that Chris organized. He was always very competent, professional, and just cool guy. He and Ari organized my favorite conference ever, the 2013 CSS Dev Conf at the haunted Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. Besides learning great stuff and meeting great people, there was a terrific ghost tour and hilarious adult-sized big-wheel races. I still have (and use) the conference mug, t-shirt, and poster handout!
