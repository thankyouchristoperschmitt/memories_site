I met Chris when I attended CSSDevConf at the Stanley Hotel. At every subsequent CSSDevConf that I attended, Chris recognized me and greeted me by name. Even in the midst of a conference he was running, he spent time chatting with me. I remember the genuine interest he displayed on the deck of the Queen Mary in Long Beach and at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.

Chris wasn't just a great conference planner or expert CSS teacher: he was an amazingly kind humjamesan.
