From the first moment in my design classes at Florida State University, I saw how smart and talented he was. He wanted to make a contribution to the web design world. He just loved it. His accomplishments speak for themselves, through his many books, articles, speaking engagements, and general presence. He shouldn't be gone. I will miss him. The field has lost a great warrior. The world has lost an incredible person.
