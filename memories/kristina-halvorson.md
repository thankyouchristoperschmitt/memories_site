Christopher had started working with a company here in Minneapolis, and he asked if I’d be willing to do a training program with the team. I hadn’t seen him in a very, very long time—years, for sure—and even then, I think the only times we’d spoken were either in video calls or in large conference environments. The day of the training, we were waiting for things to start so I was just standing quietly with him in a room with only a few others. I remember being so struck by his unusual sense of calm and just unspoken … compassion? That seems weird to say, but it’s the only word that captures what I mean. It just radiated off of him in a way that I almost never experience with people.
