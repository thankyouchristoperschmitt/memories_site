I remember Christopher's kindness toward me. We worked together on books and conferences. We met in person at SXSW several times. He treated me with respect, which was unusual from most people in the industry because I'm about 40 years older than everyone else. Many people just overlook me. I also loved how much fun he had wearing spiffy shoes. I actually have photos of his shoes! He was a pioneer and a mentor for a lot of us.
