I remember how awesome it was to have Ari and Christopher join Cospace. A few fond memories are:

1. When Pat first saw Chris' application he did a jig and was like _get him in here right now he wrote the book on HTML5!_
2. When they asked if they could redecorate the bathroom and they made it _amazing_.

I couldn't believe someone would happily devote their time, energy, and money so easily. It was such a sweet and wonderful gesture.
