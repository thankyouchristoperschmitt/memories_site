I never met Christopher, yet it always felt like I knew him. We were peers who reviewed each otherâ€™s books. The screenshot is from a book review, and through it I see both understanding and his sense of humor. With his work and passion, Christopher was an early role model and a lighthouse for the entire field of web development. Thank you, Christopher.
