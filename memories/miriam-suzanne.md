I remember the first time I met Christopher, at CSS Dev Conference in Colorado which was the first major web conference I ever attended. I didn't know anyone, and came in feeling very disconnected from the community and not sure I belonged. I met Christopher at the opening mixer. I had no idea he was The "@teleject", but he was lovely and welcomed me into the conversation. CSS Dev Conf and the online summits became essential to me after that – a central place for re-establishing community, getting inspiration, and eventually speaking. It was clear that the warmth and care of the conferences came first from Christopher and Ari, a genuine expression of their own friendly excitement. Like how they welcomed attendees personally. I will always be grateful for their role building this community and drawing me into it.
